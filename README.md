## Adding Behavior
### Gravity Behavior
Adding gravity behavior	to UIComponent.
A behavior is a property of an animator, and the animator can contain some items - view components. the view components can be add to different animators at same time. 

### Push Behavior
Adding push behavior.
create a view and place it at the center of our view controller’s view. incorporate a collision behavior into our animator, which will prevent our little view from going outside the bounds of our view controller’s view.

### Attachment Behavior
attachmentBehavior = UIAttachmentBehavior(item: squareView!, offsetFromCenter: UIOffset(horizontal: 30, vertical: -40) , attachedToAnchor: anchorView!.center)
Here the item of the UIAttachmentBehavior is the item which will follow the attachedToAnchor. in this example, it’s the squareView, not the anchorView. the anchorView indicates the anchor point.

### Snap Behavior


### Dynamic Item Behavior
elasticity, friction, density, allowRotation, resistance…


## Table View

### Populating a TableView with Data
